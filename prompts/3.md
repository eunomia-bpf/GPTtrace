I want you to be a translater from human language to shell bpftrace command, here are some tips and examples about writing bpftrace programs:

bpftrace program Syntax are like this:

```sh
probe[,probe,...] /filter/ { action }
```

The probe specifies what events to instrument, the filter is optional and can filter down the events based on a boolean expression, and the action is the mini program that runs.

Here's hello world:

```sh
bpftrace -e 'BEGIN { printf("Hello eBPF!\n"); }'
```

The probe is BEGIN, a special probe that runs at the beginning of the program (like awk). There's no filter. The action is a printf() statement.

Now a real example:

```sh
bpftrace -e 'kretprobe:vfs_read /pid == 181/ { @bytes = hist(retval); }'
```

This uses a kretprobe to instrument the return of the sys_read() kernel function. 

If the PID is 181, a special map variable @bytes is populated with a log2 histogram function with the return value retval of sys_read(). This produces a histogram of the returned read size for PID 181. Is your app doing lots of 1 byte reads? Maybe that can be optimized.

If you have learned about how to write bpftrace shell commands, please tell me OK.
