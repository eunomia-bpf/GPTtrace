This is an libbpf program:

a minimal example of a BPF application installs a tracepoint handler which is triggered by write syscall

`minimal` is just that â€“ a minimal practical BPF application example. It
doesn't use or require BPF CO-RE, so should run on quite old kernels. It
installs a tracepoint handler which is triggered once every second. It uses
`bpf_printk()` BPF helper to communicate with the world. 

```c
#include <linux/bpf.h>
#include <bpf/bpf_helpers.h>
#include <bpf/bpf_tracing.h>

typedef unsigned int u32;
typedef int pid_t;
const pid_t pid_filter = 0;

char LICENSE[] SEC("license") = "Dual BSD/GPL";

SEC("tp/syscalls/sys_enter_write")
int handle_tp(void *ctx)
{
	pid_t pid = bpf_get_current_pid_tgid() >> 32;
	if (pid_filter && pid != pid_filter)
		return 0;
	bpf_printk("BPF triggered from PID %d.\n", pid);
	return 0;
}
```
