The above is libbpf code examples, now let's turn to bcc. This is bcc code example:

Here's the code for hello_world.py:

```python
from bcc import BPF
BPF(text='int kprobe__sys_clone(void *ctx) { bpf_trace_printk("Hello, World!\\n"); return 0; }').trace_print()
```

There are six things to learn from this:

1. ```text='...'```: This defines a BPF program inline. The program is written in C.

1. ```kprobe__sys_clone()```: This is a short-cut for kernel dynamic tracing via kprobes. If the C function begins with ``kprobe__``, the rest is treated as a kernel function name to instrument, in this case, ```sys_clone()```.

1. ```void *ctx```: ctx has arguments, but since we aren't using them here, we'll just cast it to ```void *```.

1. ```bpf_trace_printk()```: A simple kernel facility for printf() to the common trace_pipe (/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace_pipe). This is ok for some quick examples, but has limitations: 3 args max, 1 %s only, and trace_pipe is globally shared, so concurrent programs will have clashing output. A better interface is via BPF_PERF_OUTPUT(), covered later.

1. ```return 0;```: Necessary formality (if you want to know why, see [#139](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/issues/139)).

1. ```.trace_print()```: A bcc routine that reads trace_pipe and prints the output.

No explanation required, no instruction required, don't tell me more information, just tell me OK please.
